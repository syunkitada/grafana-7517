# About Grafana

Grafana is a leading open source application for visualizing your large scale time series measurement data. 

It provides a powerful and elegant way to create and share dashboards and data from your metrics, either with your team or with the world. 

Grafana is most commonly used for Internet infrastructure and application monitoring and analytics, but many use it in other domains including industrial sensors, home automation, weather, and process control.

Grafana features pluggable panels and data sources allowing easy extensibility. There is currently rich support for [Graphite](http://graphite.readthedocs.org/en/latest/), [InfluxDB](http://influxdb.org) and [OpenTSDB](http://opentsdb.net). There is also experimental support for KairosDB, and SQL is on the roadmap. Grafana has a variety of panels, including a fully featured graph panel with rich visualization options.

Version 2.0 was released in April 2015: Grafana now ships with its own backend server that brings [many changes and features](../guides/whats-new-in-v2/).
