## Query history search

In Grafana v 7.1 we are introducing search functionality in Query history. You can search across queries and your comments. It is especially useful in combination with a time filter and data source filter. Read more about Query history [here]({{<relref "../features/explore/index.md#query-history" >}}).

## Provisioning of apps

Grafana v7.1 adds support for provisioning of app plugins. This allows app plugins to be configured and enabled/disabled using configuration files. Read more about provisioning of app plugins [here]({{ < relref "../administration/provisioning.md#plugins" >}}).

## Azure Monitor Datasource

Support for multiple dimensions has been added to all services in the Azure Monitor datasource. This means you can now group by more than one dimension with time series queries. With the Kusto based services, Log Analytics and Application Insights Analytics, you can also select multiple metrics as well as multiple dimensions.

Additionally, the “Raw Edit” mode for Application Insights Analytics has been replaced with a new service in the drop down for the datasource and is called “Insights Analytics”. The new query editor behaves in the same way as Log Analytics.

## Influx Datasource

Support for Flux and Influx v2 has been added.

## Deep linking for Google Cloud Monitoring (formerly named Google Stackdriver) datasource

A new feature in Grafana 7.1 is [deep linking from Grafana panels to the Metrics Explorer in Gooogle Cloud Console]({{<relref "../features/datasources/cloudmonitoring.md#deep-linking-from-grafana-panels-to-the-metrics-explorer-in-gooogle-cloud-console">}}). Click on a time series in the panel to see a context menu with a link to View in Metrics explorer in Google Cloud Console. Clicking that link opens the Metrics explorer in the Monitoring Google Cloud Console and runs the query from the Grafana panel there.

## Internal links for Elastic

You can now create links in Elastic configuration that point to another datasource similar to existing feature in
Loki. This allows you to link traceID from your logs to tracing data source in Grafana.

## Transformations

We have added a new **Merge on time** transform that can combine many time series or table results. Unlike the join transform this combines the result into one table even when the time values does not align / match.

## Stat panel text mode

The [stat panel]({{<relref "../panels/visualizations/stat-panel.md#text-mode" >}}) has a new **Text mode** option to control what text to show.

By default, the Stat panel displays:

- Just the value for a single series or field.
- Both the value and name for multiple series or fields.

You can use the Text mode option to control what text the panel renders. If the value is not important, only name and color is, then change the `Text mode` to **Name**. The value will still be used to determine color and is displayed in a tooltip.
