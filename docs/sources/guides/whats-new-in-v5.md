# What's New in Grafana v5.0

Grafana v5.0 is here and with it comes a new dashboard engine and the new feature: Dashboard folders. Grafana has never looked this good.

## New dashboard engine

The new grid system for the dashboards are more flexible than ever and are no longer dependent on rows. The panels can be organized in any way you want simply by dragging and dropping and stretching and contracting.

The rows are still there but have taken on a new role.

## UX improvements

Grafana v5.0 brings big changes to UX/UI.
There is now a dashboard settings page.

## Dashboard folders

The big new feature that comes with Grafana v5.0 is Dashboard folders. Now you can organize your dashbords into folders which is very useful if you have a lot of dashboards or multiple teams using the same Grafana instance.

Each folder has its own page where you can set permisions for the folder or single dashboards within the folder. Here you can also delete and move dashboards.

## Teams

Teams are a new concept for Grafana. Teams are simply a group of users that can be given persmisions for folders or dashboards. Only an admin can create teams.
