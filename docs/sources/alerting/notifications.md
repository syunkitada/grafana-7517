# Alert Notifications


> Alerting is only available in Grafana v4.0 and above.


When an alert changes state it sends a notification. One alert can be associated with multiple notifications. You can also configure notifications to be sent for all alerts within Grafana to make sure you wonâ€™t miss to configure notifications for an alert. 


You can find the alert notification page in the main menu under alerting. 


## Add a notifications to an Alert
You can add and remove notifications from an alert by going to the `Notifications` sub menu in the alerting tab.

Click the `+` button to add a new notification and the `x` to remove. Notifications with a blue backgrounds are enabled by default for all alerts and cannot be modified from this view.

## Default notifications


On the notifications list page (`/alerting/notifications`) you can see all notifiers that have been enabled by default. To make an notification enabled by default
you can check the `Send on all alerts` checkbox on the notification edit page.


## Testing
You can test an notification on the edit page by clicking the `Send Test` button. Grafana will then send test data based on the info on the edit page. This is a simple way of making sure that notifications are working as intended. 

## Supported notifiers
### Email


To enable email notification you have to setup [SMTP settings](/installation/configuration/#smtp) in the Grafana config. 
Email notification will upload an image of the alert graph to an external image destination if available or fallback on attaching the image in the email. 


### Webhook
The webhook notification is a simple way to send information about an state change over HTTP to a custom endpoint. 
Using this notification you could integrated Grafana into any system you choose, by yourself.  


### Slack
To set up slack you need to configure an incoming webhook url at slack. You can follow their guide for how to do that https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks
If you want to include screenshots of the firing alerts in the slack messages you have to configure the [external image destination](/alerting/notifications/#graph-screenshots-in-notifiations) in Grafana. 

Setting | Description
---------- | -----------
Recipient | allows you to override the slack recipient.
Mention | make it possible to include a mention in the slack notification sent by Grafana. Ex @here or @channel

### Pagerduty
To set up pagerduty, all you have to do is to provide an api key. 


> Our pagerduty integration only support trigger events at the moment. You have to resolve them by yourself.


## Enable screenshot of alerting graphs
Some notifiers requires you to configure the [external image uploader](/installation/configuration/#external-image-storage) to be able to upload screenshots of the alerts. This is not a requirement for any notifier within Grafana but we strongly encourage you to use it since the alert notifications give the recipient very valuable information.
