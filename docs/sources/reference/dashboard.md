# Dashboard JSON

## Overview

A dashboard in Grafana is represented by a JSON object, which stores metadata of its dashboard. Dashboard metadata includes dashboard properties, metadata from rows, panels, template variables, panel queries, etc.

To view the JSON of a dashboard, follow the steps mentioned below:

  1. Go to a dashboard
  2. Click on `Manage dashboard` menu on the top navigation bar
  3. Select `View JSON` from the dropdown menu

## Basic fields

When a user creates a new dashboard, a new dashboard JSON object is initialized with the following fields:

> Note: In the following JSON, id is shown as null which is the default value assigned to it until the dashboard is not saved. Once saved, an integer value is assigned to the `id` field.
