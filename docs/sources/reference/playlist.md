## About the Playlist

The Playlist is a special type of Dashboard that rotates through a particular list of two or more Dashboards. They can be a great way to build situational awareness or just show off your metrics to your team or visitors. Since Dashboards in Grafana automatically scale to any resolution they're perfect for big screens!

## Configuring the Playlist

The Playlist can be accessed from the main Dashboard picker. Click the 'Playlist' button at the bottom of the picker to access the Playlist functionality.
