# Playlist Guide

Playlists are sets of Dashboards that automatically and periodically switch between each other. They can be a great way to build situational awareness or just show off your metrics to your team or visitors.

Since Dashboards in Grafana automatically scale to any resolution, Playlists are perfect for big screens!

## Creating a new Playlist

Playlists can be accessed from the main Dashboard picker. Click the 'Playlists' button at the bottom of the picker to access the Playlist functionality.

You can search Dashboards by name (or use a regular expression), and add them to your Playlist.

### Configuring the Playlist

## Starting and controlling Playlists

Playlists can also be manually controlled utilizing the controls at the top of screen when in Playlist mode. 

Click the stop button to pause on that particular Dashboard.
Click the next button to advance to the next Dashboard in the Playlist.
Click the back button to rewind to the previous Dashboard in the Playlist.
