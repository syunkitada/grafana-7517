# OpenTSDB Guide

## Adding the data source to Grafana
Open the side menu by clicking the the Grafana icon in the top header. In the side menu under the `Dashboards` link you
should find a link named `Data Sources`. If this link is missing in the side menu it means that your current
user does not have the `Admin` role for the current organization.
