# Reporting

Reporting allows you to automatically generate PDFs from any of your dashboards and have Grafana email them to interested parties on a schedule.

> Only available in Grafana Enterprise v6.4+.

Any changes you make to a dashboard used in a report are reflected the next time the report is sent. For example, if you change the time range in the dashboard, then the time range in the report changes as well.

## Requirements

* SMTP must be configured for reports to be sent. Refer to [SMTP]({{< relref "../installation/configuration.md#smtp" >}}) in [Configuration]({{< relref "../installation/configuration.md" >}}) for more information.
* The Image Renderer plugin must be installed or the remote rendering service must be set up. Refer to [Image rendering]({{< relref "../administration/image_rendering.md" >}}) for more information.

## Create or update a report

Currently only Organization Admins can create reports.

1. Click on the reports icon in the side menu. The Reports tab allows you to view, create, and update your reports.
1. Enter report information. All fields are required unless otherwise indicated.
   * **Name -** Name of the report as you want it to appear in the Reports list.
   * **Choose dashboard -** Select the dashboard to generate the report from.

## Send test mail

> Only available in Grafana Enterprise v7.0+.

1. In the report, click **Send test mail**.
1. In the Email field, enter the email address or addresses that you want to test, separated by semicolon.
If you want to use email addresses from the report, then select the **Use emails from report** check box.
1. Click **Send**.

The last saved version of the report will be sent to selected emails. You can use this to verify emails are working and to make sure the report is generated and displayed as you expect.

## Rendering configuration

When Grafana generates a report, it will render each panel separately and then put them together in a PDF file. You can configure the per-panel rendering request timeout and the maximum number of concurrent calls to the rendering service. These options are available in the [configuration]({{< relref "../installation/configuration.md">}}) file.

```ini
[reporting]
# Set timeout for each panel rendering request
rendering_timeout = 10s
# Set maximum number of concurrent calls to the rendering service
concurrent_render_limit = 4
```

## Troubleshoot reporting

To troubleshoot and get more log information, enable debug logging in the configuration file. Refer to [Configuration]({{< relref "../installation/configuration.md#filters" >}}) for more information.

```bash
[log]
filters = report:debug
```
