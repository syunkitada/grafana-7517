# Sign a plugin

Signing a plugin allows Grafana to [verify the authenticity of the plugin]({{< relref "../../plugins/plugin-signature-verification.md" >}}) and by that give users a way to make sure plugins haven't been tampered with. All Grafana Labs authored backend plugins, including Enterprise plugins, are signed.

We're looking into providing a process for allowing community plugins to be signed in an upcoming version of Grafana.
