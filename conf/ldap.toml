# In POSIX LDAP schemas, without memberOf attribute a secondary query must be made for groups.
# This is done by enabling group_search_filter below. You must also set member_of= "cn"
# in [servers.attributes] below.

# Users with nested/recursive group membership must have an LDAP server that supports LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN
# and set group_search_filter below in such a way that it returns the groups the submitted username is a member of.
#
# Nested Groups + Active Directory (AD) Example:
#
#   AD groups store the Distinguished Names (DNs) of members, so your filter will need to know the DN
#   for the user based only on the submitted username. Multiple DN templates can be
#   searched by combining filters with the LDAP or operator.
#
#   Some examples:
#     group_search_filter = "(member:1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941:=CN=%s,[user container/OU])"
#     group_search_filter = "(|(member:1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941:=CN=%s,[user container/OU])(member:1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941:=CN=%s,[another user container/OU]))"
#
#   You might also want to change member_of in [servers.attributes] to "distinguishedName". This
#   does not appear to be necessary but it will show you more accurate group membership if
#   verbose_logging is enabled.
